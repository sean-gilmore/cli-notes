# Intro

cli-notes is a tool for managing your markdown notes. It has a couple of basic
assumptions that it makes about the sort of notes you make;

1. You like writing your notes in markdown
2. They are either plain notes, meeting notes, or todo lists
3. You keep your notes in a nested folder structure
4. Creating a new note, and putting it in the right place is the most painful part of the note taking life-cycle

If you find yourself agreeing with this list of issues, then this project is for you.
